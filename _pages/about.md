## üîç Research Focus
I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Auckland, specializing in relational database theory with a focus on data normalization techniques and anomaly detection from system logs. My work mainly consists of the following areas:

- **Schema Design Optimization**:  
  Developing novel normalization algorithms to minimize data redundancy and improve update efficiency while preserving functional dependencies.
  
- **Update Cost Reduction**:  
  Quantifying the trade-offs between normalization levels and update overheads in databse systems.

- **Mining FDs/Keys from Data**:  
  Mining some meaningful Functional Dependencies/Keys from data with domain expert knowledge.

- **Detecting Anomalies from System Logs**:  
  Mining anomalous patterns from system logs to find root causes via deep learning techniques.
