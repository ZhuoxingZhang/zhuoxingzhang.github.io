## üîç Research Focus
I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Auckland, specializing in relational database theory with a focus on data normalization techniques. My work bridges theoretical foundations with practical optimization, specifically investigating:

- **Schema Design Optimization**:  
  Developing novel normalization algorithms to minimize data redundancy and improve update efficiency while preserving functional dependencies.
  
- **Update Cost Reduction**:  
  Quantifying the trade-offs between normalization levels and update overheads in databse systems.
